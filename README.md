This is a simple small scoped Tik Tok clone project using React for the frontend, MongoDB as a database and Express and NodeJS for the backend.
This web app uses functional React components and  also  material-ui library for the Tik Tok like icons and other components. 
The backend consists of GET and POST request to retrieve the videos and also add the videos to the app. Database currently supports videos that are hosted in 3rd party websites.

To run this app in your local environment, you should run at the same time the frontend and backend using the command:
```bash
npm run start
```

You need to update the connection url by settling up your own connectiong using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/)

The current MongoDB connectionURL contains a dummy link to inform developers that the provided URL needs to be in similar format.

This is one of my first full stack projects from which I improved my React and Node Js skills. I hope it will help you learn stuff as well.
